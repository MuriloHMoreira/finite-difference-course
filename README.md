finite-difference-course
========================
Material for a course on finite difference methods for differential equations.

Course materials (syllabus and assignments) can be found linked from the 
[course page](https://github.com/ketch/finite-difference-course/wiki).

The course closely follows [Randall LeVeque's text](http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/fdmbook/).
The additional material here includes 
[IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html).
If you want to view the notebooks without installing IPython, you can use [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org).
For instance, see [a notebook on the basics of finite differences](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/ketch/finite-difference-course/master/ipython/Finite_differences.ipynb).
