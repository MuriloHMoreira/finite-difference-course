finite-difference-course
========================

Material for a partially-flipped course on finite difference methods for differential equations.
The course is based heavily on [Randall LeVeque's text](http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/fdmbook/).
The material here includes [IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html).
If you want to view the notebooks without installing IPython, you can use [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org).
For instance, see [a notebook on the basics of finite differences](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/ketch/finite-difference-course/master/ipython/Finite_differences.ipynb).
